                    <h3>Meet Marina!</h3>
                    <p>Born and raised in Veles, Macedonia, Marina is one of those people
                        who left their comfortable home at young age, to travel the world
                        and learn about life. Her style is to stay in one place she likes
                        for 3 months (or more) every year, to know what it feels like to eat, cook,
                        speak and sleep in another culture that isn’t hers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Work and Travel</h3>
                    <p>Most of the time, in order to find accommodation more easily while staying
                        in different countries, she gets a job and stays with a work visa.
                        According to her, working in a different job, in a different country,
                        with different nationalities of colleagues and clients,
                        is the best way to experience the spirit of the country she visited.</p>
                    <h3>Let's go on andventure, together!</h3>
                    <p>
                        What happens if I go out there on my own and work for myself, don't share
                        anything and travel the world alone?
                        I am still doing that, but in this blog, I will share
                        with you all the joys, successes, and struggles of this life adventure,
                        so I hope i'll motivate someone to start a new life experience!
